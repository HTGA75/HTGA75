# 👋 Hey there, I'm building the web

I'm a first-year student diving deep into full-stack development, turning ideas into functional applications that people can actually use. Currently exploring the intersection of AI and web technologies while studying Applied AI and Data Science.

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With

```javascript
const techStack = {
  frontend: ['React', 'Next.js', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind CSS'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'APIs', 'Appwrite'],
  languages: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'TypeScript'],
  focus: ['Accessibility', 'Performance', 'Scalable Architecture']
}
```

## 💡 Current Focus

- Building production-ready full-stack applications
- Exploring AI integration in web apps
- Optimizing for performance and accessibility
- Learning advanced React patterns and state management

## 📈 My Approach

I don't just complete tutorials — I extend them, break them, and rebuild them better. Every project is an opportunity to push beyond the basics and understand the "why" behind the code.

**100+ projects** → Real learning comes from doing  
**2 years** → Consistent growth and iteration  
**Full-stack mindset** → From UI polish to backend architecture

## 🌱 Learning Journey

Started with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript fundamentals. Progressed through React and modern frontend development. Now building complete full-stack applications with real-world features like authentication, file storage, and AI integrations.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

Always open to collaborating on interesting projects, discussing tech, or helping fellow developers. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if something catches your eye!
